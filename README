# WebForms-CRUD-ContactsAndEmailSender

An ASP.NET Web Forms application demonstrating contact management (CRUD), data display using Web Forms controls, and sending emails with attachments.
The project focuses on clean structure and reusability by placing most database and email logic inside custom helper classes located in the **App_Code** folder.

---

## 1. Project Overview

This project was built as a practical learning exercise to:

* Implement full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for contact records.
* Use SQL Server as a backend with a centralized connection string in `Web.config`.
* Display data in controls such as **GridView** and **DropDownList**.
* Send emails with file attachments using an SMTP configuration.
* Reuse logic by organizing database and email functionality into dedicated helper classes rather than writing repetitive code inside each page.

---

## 2. Main Features

* Contact management form with fields for ID, first name, last name, cell, email, and country.
* Buttons to:

  * Insert a new contact
  * Retrieve and display an existing contact
  * Update a contact
  * Delete a contact
* Phone directory display page.
* Email sending page with:

  * Sender email
  * Subject and message fields
  * File attachments
  * Two sending options (via helper class or direct code-behind)
* A structured Web Forms layout using a master page and content pages.
* Configuration-driven behavior using `Web.config`.

## 3. Solution Structure

### **App_Code Folder**

This folder contains the main helper classes used throughout the project.

---

### 🔹 **CRUD Class (Custom, Fully Developed)**

A comprehensive data-access utility class that you created to consolidate most common SQL Server operations into one reusable location.
Its responsibilities include:

* Managing SQL connections using a single connection string from `Web.config`.
* Executing different types of commands:

  * SQL queries that return data readers.
  * Queries that return DataTables or DataSets.
  * Stored procedures (with and without parameters).
  * Insert/Update/Delete operations returning affected rows.
  * Commands that return identity values for inserted rows.
* User-related checks such as:

  * Verifying if a user already exists.
  * Authenticating users based on form input.
* UI helper functions for:

  * Populating **DropDownList** controls.
  * Populating **GridView** controls (via reader or DataTable).
* Utility methods for connection pool cleanup.

This class acts as a **personal mini-library** for all CRUD and data-binding operations in Web Forms, reducing repeated ADO.NET code across the application.

### 🔹 **mailMgr Class (Imported and Customized)**

The `mailMgr` class was originally taken from an external educational resource, then **modified and adapted** to fit the structure of this project.

Its responsibilities include:

* Reading SMTP and email configuration settings from `Web.config`.
* Building email messages with:

  * Sender information
  * Subject
  * Body text
  * Optional file attachments
* Sending the email using the SMTP settings.
* Returning success or error feedback to the calling page.

It is used in `sendEmail.aspx` to simplify the sending process and maintain cleaner page code.

> Note: The class is not fully self-developed — it was imported then customized for this project.

---

## 4. Project Pages

### **myServiceControl.aspx**

Main CRUD page for managing contact information. Includes:

* Form inputs for contact details.
* Buttons for Insert, Show, Update, and Delete.
* GridView for displaying stored data.
* All logic is powered by the CRUD helper class.

---

### **phoneDirectory.aspx**

A directory-style page listing stored contacts using CRUD methods.

---

### **ServiceControl.aspx**

A supporting page that interacts with the same CRUD logic for service-related operations.

---

### **sendEmail.aspx**

A dedicated page for sending emails:

* Sender email, subject, and message fields.
* File attachment upload.
* Send button using:

  * `mailMgr` class
  * or direct code-behind as a comparison option.

---

### Shared Files

* **Default.aspx, About.aspx, Contact.aspx** – Standard content pages.
* **Site.Master** – Master layout for consistent design.
* **Web.config** – SMTP settings, connection strings, and global configuration.
* **Global.asax** – Application-level event handler.
* **Content, Scripts** – CSS/JS assets.

---

## 5. Technologies Used

* ASP.NET Web Forms (C#)
* SQL Server / SQL Express
* ADO.NET (connections, commands, readers, datasets)
* SMTP email sending
* Web.config configuration management
* Web Forms server controls:

  * TextBox, DropDownList, Button, GridView, FileUpload, Label

---

## 6. Key Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates practical experience in:

* Structuring a Web Forms application with a master page.
* Creating a robust custom CRUD utility class for centralized data access.
* Importing and customizing email-sending logic via a helper class.
* Working with SQL Server using several ADO.NET techniques.
* Binding data to ASP.NET UI controls efficiently.
* Managing sensitive settings in `Web.config`.
* Implementing real-world functionality such as email sending with attachments.

Developed by **Soha Abdurahman** as a personal project to consolidate frequently used database and email operations into reusable helper classes, and to apply them in a working ASP.NET Web Forms environment.
